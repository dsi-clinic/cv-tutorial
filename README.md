This repo contains some exercises and information for deep learning tutorials for the University of Chicago's Data Science Institute.

Our deep learning tutorials are focused on developing some theoretical intuition for what deep learning models are doing as well as hands-on PyTorch skills.

The code in this repo is for some of the later tutorials and activities.

Here is the outline for the tutorials as well as links to activity notebooks and additional resources.

### Lesson 1: Linear Regression & Parameter Estimation

### Lesson 2: Logistic Regression

### Lesson 3: Computer Vision & Convolutional Neural Networks

### Lesson 4: Cross-Entropy Loss & Back Propagation

### Lesson 5: Transformers & Natural Language Processing

### Lesson 6: Debugging
